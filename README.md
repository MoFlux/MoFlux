- 👋 Hi, I’m @MoFlux  (just going to fill this out real quick... why not!!) 
- 👀 I’m interested in making the world a better place. NOT by doing the work for other people, rather by teaching and empowering others to create for themselves.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning FreeCAD , all the raspberry pi/arduino/esp stuff.  Current goal is to grow food. Long term goal is to make contraptions, inventions, explore physics & mathematics. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I got on github to help some opensource projects. Also, upload any code which may be useful to others. I do have a project which could use some collab. It's a fully 3D printed electromagnet coil winder. It's really useful and works well. The code side is a huge undertaking. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... I've been off of social media for roughly 10 years. I'll do contact info later...
